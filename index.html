      <h1 class="title main-title">What are electrolytes?</h1>
      <p class="text main-text">
        Electrolytes are substances that when dissolved in water dissociate into
        cations and anions, thus producing a solution that can conduct
        electricity. The dissociation does not lean towards more cations or more
        anions, so the solution remains neutral. Dissociation is when molecules
        break up into smaller parts, and in the situation with electrolytes,
        particularly ions.
      </p>
      <p class="text main-text">
        The strength of the electrolyte is extrapolated from the amount of
        dissociation that occurs from the electrolyte being added to water. So,
        the more ions in the solution after the electrolyte is added, the
        stronger the electrolyte is. If no dissociation occurs, then the
        substance is not an ion.
      </p>
      <h1 class="title main-title">Electrolytes in the Human Body</h1>
      <p class="text main-text">
        Some common electrolytes in the human body include calcium, sodium,
        potassium, chloride, magnesium, and bicarbonate. Each of these
        electrolytes seves its own purpose for the human body. Most fall into
        the similar category of maintaining equilibrium with the solution that
        the cells are in to the cells themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="text main-text">
        Sodium, or Na+, is an electrolyte that is obtained mostly from table
        salt. Sodium helps regulate the osmosis that occurs in cells to regulate
        the overall amount of water in the body. Also, since the nervous system
        requires electricity to signal for communication, sodium is important
        for the generation of the signals.
      </p>
      <p class="text main-text">
        Chloride, just like sodium is obtained from the consumption of table
        salt. It helps to maintain a balance with most fluids of the body and is
        usually found in the outside of cells or blood. It also plays a vital
        role in keeping the body at the right pH level.
      </p>
      <p class="text main-text">
        Potassium is an important cation for the body. The functions of
        potassium include keeping a regular heartbeat and helping with muscle
        function. Potassium also plays a role for nueral communication.
      </p>
      <p class="text main-text">Magnesium plays a critical role in the creation of both RNA and DNA. It boosts the immune system, and helps maintain normal functions of pretty much everything in your body. It even takes a part of over 300 biochemical reactions!</p>
      <p class="text main-text">Both calcium and phosphorous work to strengthen the bones and teeth. Phosphorous is crucial for energy production at the cellular level while calcium is necessary for blood clots. Phosphorous is also necessary for the growth and repair of tissues. </p>
      <p class="text main-text">Bicarbonate is hugely vital in the controlling of pH levels in the body. It is used as a buffer for the acidity of blood and other bodily fluids. Bicarbonate itself is an alkaline solution, so when the body is getting acidic, more of it is released. When it is heading towards more alkalinity, less will be released.</p>
